**Art is the way of life**

The oldest reminiscences of
civilizations are the pieces that man created in forms of cave illustrations,
stone sculptures and clay innovations.These items, then humble creations of evolution and utility, are today
known to be monumental masterpieces that have withstood the tests of time,
durability and inquisitiveness. 

The subject of Visual Arts is
hence the study and practice of working with medium or media that appeal the
visual perception. Dimensions, texture, colours, meaning or abstraction,
positioning, point of view and human labour and ultimately the craftsmanship,
define the aesthetics in a piece of visual art. The wide ambit of VA could be
classified into fine arts, contemporary arts and decorative crafts.

**A piece of art is a poem without words**

Visual Arts empowers the students
to get hands-on engagement and create their own learning, as a result deepening
their level of understanding about diverse topics about science, geometry,
literature and social studies. The study and engagement in visual arts in
schools forges better academic, social and inter-personal performance levels. 

**Art is not extra, it is integral**

Not Just Studies is an
organization that aims to manifest the change in the way visual arts with all
its scope and techniques is taught in an academically rich and focused set-up
today. The curriculum is comprehensively designed and encompasses a thorough
range of activities to stimulate the children's ability to visualize and
exercise their ideas. The program is a complete package that endeavours to
deliver significant and measurable results in the visual arts orientation of
the students by the way of a scientifically designed curriculum, training the
art teachers from each school on how to follow the same and consistently
evaluating both the teachers and the students to attain the distinguished
levels of performance.

The NJS-VA program lays very **clear and coherent guidelines and learning
goals **that are held up parallel
to the academic growth and ensure a balanced, fulfilling overall development of
a child.

The NJS-VA program is a
thoroughly researched and well-structured curriculum designed to channelize the
young talent in developing the sense of appreciation for the cultural environment
and arts in local, regional, national and global contexts. Through this
program, we also give exposure and guidance to the children on how to amplify
the skill set to the next level and explore new age career opportunities.

**Artists never retire because art is a way of life**

With path breaking progress that
has happened in Internet, multimedia and entertainment, the need for highly
skilled artists and designers is like never before. The trend is on a steep
rise and will continue to be, in times to come. As the students' progress in
the NJS-VA program, they are capacitated to choose from the array of advanced
studies after they pass from grade 12\. Some of the country's most prestigious
institutions and universities offer courses in the fields of painting, design,
applied arts, planning, architecture, design communications, production and
management, graphics, animation, film-making and much more. Being able to
secure an admission in these esteemed colleges itself secures a bright career
for the children and our program focuses on preparing the students for the
same.
