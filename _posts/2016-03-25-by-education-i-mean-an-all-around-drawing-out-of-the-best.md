# "By education, I mean
an all around drawing out of the best in the child and man - body,
mind and spirit" --        M. K. Gandhi, 1937

Not Just Studies (NJS) is an organization that works dynamically in the fields of sports and extracurricular activities. NJS's core philosophy is to build on top of the excellent social and scholastic fabric, which our schools have created. NJS utilizes the existing infrastructure of schools and leverages it further by applying methods and practices of learning via the exceptional crew of subject experts. The program is delivered within the school premises and within the schools' charter so that it is easier and simpler for all the key stakeholders viz. students, schoolteachers and parents, to appreciate and to see value in it. The ultimate goal of NJS is to bring the practical exposure to children of all ages via hands-on, goal oriented and scientifically proven techniques of learning.
