# NJS Physical Education and Sports Program

Schools are the temple of
learning and provide the most effective muscle building towards academic
excellence. Over last few decades, schools in India have evolved the learning
methods and have made a key contribution towards society. No wonder, India is
home to so many professionals in the field of engineering, medicine and
research. At the global level, Indian talent is a proven example for
intelligence and work ethics, honed via the clinically executed, disciplined
teaching methods that inculcating the perseverance, focus and hard work.

**Every child's need and right**

India, as a nation, sees a long
way to go in the arena of physical health, physical education and sports. With
only a handful of committed and dedicated professional coaches, there is a growing
void calling for larger support from the greater community. Institutions, that
provide an impeccable learning platform and developed infrastructure, have
invested in passionate sports trainers and equipment. Yet, they long for the
innovation it needs. 

**The spirit of sportsmanship**

Parents and teachers alike
understand the benefits of sports on physical, mental, emotional as well as
psycho-social health of the society. In the endeavour to develop health and
physical fitness of the children, the adults today seek opportunities to
channelize the young energy into constructive sports. Numerous researches
emphasize the impact of sports on mental agility, academic performance and
emotional stamina. The discipline of training and adaptation, learning teamwork
and peer relationships, following the leadership of coaches and captains,
learning to lose --- all these make for lifelong skills for the young
individuals. In the fiercely competitive world, it also gives each one an added
edge of lining up alternate vocations and career options. The positive effect
of embracing sports and physical activities manifest in the shortest time and
reflect on every child's personality.

**Sport provides an opportunity
for children to safely navigate and negotiate between right and wrong as they
learn to interact with peers and adults**

• Sport offers competition without violence

• Brings people together

• Gives sense of belonging

• Builds cognitive skills

• Promises great health

• Unlimited supply of all-round motivation

Not Just Studies, an organization
that specializes in imparting methodological coaching and cultivation to
students of all ages, offers an anchoring program in physical education and
sports. We aim to ensure development of wholesome personality of the children
by making them physically fit, mentally sound, socially-emotionally stable and
spiritually stimulated. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e49ea273-ca97-4b9d-8f97-2caf509e7676.jpg)
