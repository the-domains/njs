Not Just Studies (NJS) is an
organization that works dynamically in the fields of sports and extracurricular
activities. NJS's core philosophy is to build on top of the excellent social
and scholastic fabric, which our schools have created. NJS utilizes the
existing infrastructure of schools and leverages it further by applying methods
and practices of learning via the exceptional crew of subject experts. The
program is delivered within the school premises and within the schools' charter
so that it is easier and simpler for all the key stakeholders viz. students,
schoolteachers and parents, to appreciate and to see value in it. The ultimate
goal of NJS is to bring the practical exposure to children of all ages via
hands-on, goal oriented and scientifically proven techniques of learning.

**Creative muscle needs a creative activity to keep it in shape **

The need and benefits of physical
activity is well understood and we all strive to be physically active and
healthy. At a school level, we engage students in various facets of PE
(Physical Education) and invest our time and effort towards it. Just like our
body, our mind also needs the right exercises to keep it creatively active. NJS
can help schools tackle this gap and prepare them to be the leaders in this
space.

**"To define is to limit" - Oscar Wilde**

Performing arts range from dance,
music, theater and musical theater, magic, illusion, mime, spoken word,
puppetry, circus arts, performance art, recitation and public speaking. In the
Indian cultural context, various forms of performing arts have evolved over the
centuries and have convoluted beautifully with our rich cultural heritage.
Broadly the performing arts can be classified into two categories:

- Folk forms, the utilitarian and
decorative styles that emerge out of innumerable indigenous cultures

- Classical art forms, the
well-defined, technical and aesthetic styles that evolve over generations on
study and have set guidelines for the realm

**"Creativity is intelligence having fun" -- Albert Einstein**

The positive impact of exposure
to performing arts on the children's academic, social and emotional development
is an established truth.**Dance** develops
the self-confidence and persistence; **music
**enhances self-efficacy and self-concept; **drama **hones concentration, comprehension, conflict resolution, and
self-concept. In total, performing arts form a very important dimension of life
and correlate directly to self-confidence, motivation, exploration and risk-taking
abilities, cognitive engagement, perseverance and leadership. 

**"The earth has music for those who listen" - William Shakespeare**

The NJS-PA program is broadly
divides into three sub-categories -- dance, music and theatre with focused
curricula for four different age groups. Each subject comes with well-defined lesson
plans and a teachers' manual targeted at the respective defined age group. 

**The format of dance education and objectives**

The program has different
approach and objectives for the four set of age groups. The focus for the **pre-primary group** is on seeding the
sense of art and aesthetics, developing the sensory of rhythm, motor movements
and synchronizing the thought and body. For the children in the **primary group**, we add more physical
movements, elevate the range of rhythm and balance and focus on preparing the
body language and flexibility for the next steps. We also add theory, whilst
keeping up the children's level of interest. The training is broad and
preparatory in these two groups. From the middle group onward, there would be a choice of specialized coaching between
the Indian and Western dance forms (Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Kathak, Salsa,
Hip-hop and more). 

As the pupils follow a stream of
a form of dance in the **middle group**
(grade 6-8), they would get the basic orientation of the respective form,
understand the rhythm and the body language of the discipline; learn basic
units and get acquainted with the theory and history of that form. In the **senior age group** (grade 9-12), our
curriculum takes them to a serious level with intricate understanding of the _Raga _(music), _Tala _(rhythm) and _Bhava _(mood
and expressions) in the realms of _Nritta _(abstract),
_Nritya _(relative) and _Natya _(dramatic) with the nuances of the
various classical schools of the respective dance.
